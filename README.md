Double click start.
- You should see a message saying it is ready

Double click localhost.
- You should see it say connected

If you know the IP address of your device, enter the last two digits.
- It will autofill 192.168 if you enter the last two digits and also add .1. if you only put the very last.
If you do not, just click connect. The server will detect the packets broadcasted and connect that way.
